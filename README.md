### Mini Project - Error Handling in Shell Scripting

Error handling is a fundamental aspect of shell scripting that enhances reliability by anticipating and managing failures. Effective scripting involves identifying potential error sources—such as incorrect inputs, unavailable resources, or system limitations—and implementing robust solutions. Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) are key tools for evaluating exit statuses (`$?`) to determine success or failure, providing clear and user-friendly feedback. A practical example is S3 bucket creation: blindly attempting to recreate an existing bucket leads to errors, but using `aws s3api head-bucket` as a pre-check prevents unnecessary failures. By handling errors gracefully, scripts ensure seamless execution, prevent unintended consequences, and improve overall efficiency. Thoughtful error management transforms a script from a basic automation tool into a resilient and intelligent system.
